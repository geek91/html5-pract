					The Mojave phone booth was a lone telephone booth in what is now the Mojave National Preserve in California, which attracted online attention in 1997, due to its unusual location.
					Placed in the 1960s, the booth was eight miles (13 km) from the nearest paved road, fifteen miles (24 km) from the nearest numbered highway, and miles from any buildings. The original hand-cranked magneto phone had been set up in the 1960s to provide telephone service to local volcanic cinder miners, and other people living in the area. Godfrey Daniels, a local computer entrepreneur, found the telephone and started the first of several websites devoted to the booth. Soon, fans called the booth attempting to get a reply, and a few took trips to the booth to answer. Over time, the booth became covered in graffiti, as many travelers would leave messages on it.

It was finally removed by Pacific Bell on May 17, 2000, at the request of the National Park Service. Officially, the removal was done to halt the environmental impact of visitors, though pressure from locals unhappy with the increased traffic may have contributed.
